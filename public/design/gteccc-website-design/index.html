<h2 id="the-greater-toronto-eritrean-canadian-community-centre">The Greater Toronto Eritrean Canadian Community Centre</h2>
<p>The Greater Toronto Eritrean Canadian Community Centre (GTECCC) has been a cornerstone for Eritrean-Canadians in Ontario, ensuring support for vulnerable populations such as newcomers, refugees, youth, and seniors.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Based off of our discussions with GTECCC board members as well as secondary research, we identified GTECCC&rsquo;s current challenges:</p>
<p><strong>Scattered, Temporary Information</strong><br>
GTECCC currently relies on WhatsApp and Facebook to provide their services to the Eritrean community in the GTA. However, these platforms are not serving the diverse needs of the community as the decentralized and temporary nature of messages and posts makes accessing GTECCC’s resources difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Spam and Trust Issues</strong><br>
From an administrative perspective, GTECCC faces challenges with spam posting on their Facebook and Whatsapp groups which burdens other users and distracts from important resources that GTECCC shares in these groups.</p>
<p><strong>Language and Digital Barriers</strong><br>
Many community members faced language challenges or limited digital literacy, making it hard to participate fully.</p>
<p><strong>Generational Disconnect</strong><br>
Younger members felt disconnected from traditional events, while older members struggled to foster engagement across generations.</p>
<h2 id="research-and-analysis">Research and Analysis</h2>
<p>Our team employed a participatory research approach, using the World Café method to gather insights from community members. We facilitated discussions, card-sorting activities, and drawing sessions, engaging all types of members including newcomers, seniors, youth, and board members. Data was captured and affinity mapped on Miro.</p>
<p><img class="uncompressed"  src="/images/gteccc-world-cafe-analysis.jpg" alt="my image description" /></p>
<p><strong>Key Insights</strong><br>
GTECCC members sought a centralized digital hub where they could easily access relevant resources in both English and Tigrinya, connect with one another across generations, and have their voices heard in the services provided by GTECCC.</p>
<h2 id="design-approach">Design Approach</h2>
<p>Based on our research, we proposed a structured, user-centered design solution for GTECCC’s website:</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Resource Guides</strong>
The website features a robust set of resource guides, with a particular focus on the Newcomers Guide, helping individuals navigate settlement, employment, healthcare, education, and more. These guides serve as a permanent, one-stop hub for essential information, making it easier for community members to access support.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose Driven Integration</strong>
The website complements, rather than replaces, existing communication tools. WhatsApp remains the space for real-time updates and conversations, Facebook is used for broader outreach and community engagement, while the website serves as a structured, permanent home for resources, events, and official information.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback Form</strong>
A dedicated space allows users to share feedback anonymously about GTECCC services. This fosters honest community input, helping the organization continuously improve its programs and better serve its members.</p>
<p><strong>Community Articles and Storytelling</strong>
The website integrates a community blog where members can submit stories, insights, and experiences. This helps strengthen community ties, highlight achievements, and showcase the diverse voices within GTECCC.</p>
<p><strong>Mentorship Programs</strong>
Integrated a mentorship program with its own page, sign-up forms for both mentees and mentors, and advertising it throughout the site (e.g. on the homepage and on the resource pages).</p>
<h2 id="usability-testing-and-insights">Usability Testing and Insights</h2>
<p>In addition to our primary research, we conducted usability testing with members of the GTECCC community. These sessions allowed us to validate our design decisions, identify pain points, and uncover areas for improvement. Participants shared their thoughts on navigation, accessibility, and the clarity of information presented on the prototype. Based on their feedback, we made several key changes to the site’s structure and functionality:</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Resource Page</strong>
Filter options were used to select for specific types of resources. Users found them either too small or did not notice them. We removed the filters and organized resources by headings, implemented horizontal scroll for cards in each subsections, and removed dates in the cards and only kept permanently available resources as GTECCC was not going to update the resources regularly.</p>
<p><img class="uncompressed"  src="/images/gteccc-usability-testing-resources.jpg" alt="my image description" /></p>
<p><strong>Simplified Forms</strong>
Users found the requirements on the various forms confusing and long, leading to paticipants wanting to drop-out of the process. We simplified the forms to only ask relevant and important information.</p>
<p><img class="uncompressed"  src="/images/gteccc-usability-testing-forms.jpg" alt="my image description" /></p>
<h2 id="supporting-the-next-steps">Supporting the Next Steps</h2>
<p>To help GTECCC move forward with the website development and content creation, we provided several resources and recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>Development Options</strong>
Outlined six approaches to website development, including vetted web developers, Canada Summer Jobs and UofT Workstudy positions, and alternative sources of developer talent.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>
Conducted a comparative analysis of website builders, highlighting the pros and cons of each option and offering tailored recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Content Templates</strong>
Created a comprehensive Google Docs template that included English drafts of each page, structured formatting, and a dedicated column for Tigrinya translations. This template served as a guide for the community to develop and maintain content on their own.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Through our work with GTECCC, we gained valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of conducting user research. In-person sessions were more effective at engaging participants and resolving translation difficulties. Remote sessions sometimes resulted in participants being unable to continue due to technical issues that we couldn’t troubleshoot from a distance. This reinforced the importance of in-person engagement, especially when working with community members where English is their second or third language or who may have limited access to or experience with digital tools.</p>
