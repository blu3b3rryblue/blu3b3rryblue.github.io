## Ontario Public Service

The Government of Ontario includes ministries, agencies and Crown corporations. Its workforce of 60,000+ public servants is called the Ontario Public Service (OPS).

## Project Background

In collaboration with the Treasury Board Secretariat’s resource acquisition team, we embarked on a user research project to understand the experiences of designers throughout their tenure in the Ontario Public Service (OPS). The goal of the resource aquisition team is to attract top talent and retain skilled service designers within government roles.

## Semi-structured Interviews

## Findings

**Non-Competitive Pay**  
Many designers expressed concerns about unclear salary ranges and the difficulty of negotiating compensation. This, coupled with lower pay compared to the private sector, contributed to challenges in both attracting and retaining top talent.

**Fragmented Hiring Process**  
The OPS hiring process, particularly through the Ontario job portal, was described as cumbersome and not user-friendly. Participants also noted that job descriptions often didn’t align with actual job responsibilities, creating confusion and mismatched expectations.

**Onboarding Inconsistencies**  
Onboarding experiences varied widely, with some new hires feeling unsupported and regretful of their decision to join the OPS. A lack of clear guidance on benefits and inconsistent processes led to initial dissatisfaction and slower productivity.

**Organizational Silos**  
Designers often faced barriers due to organizational silos, which hindered collaboration and cross-ministry knowledge sharing. These silos contributed to inefficiencies, duplicative efforts, and a fragmented approach to service design.

**Limited Career Progression**  
There were few established roles for advancement beyond senior designer positions. Many designers felt stuck, with no clear ladder to climb or opportunities to grow within the organization without moving into management.

**Advocacy Burden**  
Designers reported spending excessive time defending the value of their work to leadership. This constant advocacy reduced the time and energy available for creating impactful design solutions.

**Lack of Development Opportunities**  
Limited access to professional development resources left designers feeling stagnant in their roles. Opportunities for skill building, mentorship, and hands-on learning were seen as insufficient to support career growth.

---

## Findings

**Key Motivators for Joining Government Work**  
- **Job Stability and Security:** The stability of government roles and the opportunity to move between different positions were strong draws for many participants.  
- **Social Impact:** Designers were motivated by the opportunity to deliver meaningful services that benefit a wide audience.  
- **Collaboration and Mission:** Participants valued the chance to work with dedicated colleagues and tackle complex, mission-driven challenges.

**Common Frustrations**  
- **Cumbersome Processes:** Bureaucratic hurdles and long approval timelines made project completion and tool acquisition difficult.  
- **Disconnection from Leadership:** Limited interaction with upper management and lack of a unified vision created challenges in gaining support and recognition for design efforts.  
- **Inadequate Tools and Resources:** Many designers struggled with insufficient equipment and a lack of access to industry-standard tools.  
- **Lack of Community and Support:** Designers working in isolation or as sole practitioners often felt disconnected and unsupported, leading to higher burnout rates and lower job satisfaction.

---

## Recommendations

**#1 – Highlight the Benefits of Government Work:**  
- Showcase projects with significant social impact to attract mission-driven designers.  
- Emphasize job stability, pensions, and work-life balance as key advantages in recruitment materials.

**#2 – Improve Hiring Processes:**  
- Standardize job descriptions and titles to ensure consistency and transparency.  
- Clarify salary ranges and set clear expectations during recruitment.  
- Streamline the application process and improve the job portal’s usability.

**#3 – Enhance Onboarding Experiences:**  
- Provide a standardized onboarding framework, including dedicated buddies, clear benefits guidance, and early access to essential tools.  
- Develop centralized onboarding documentation to ensure consistency and reduce new hire confusion.

**#4 – Increase Understanding of Design:**  
- Train leaders and managers on the value and process of design.  
- Share best practices and design standards across the organization to build a more informed and supportive environment.

**#5 – Build a Stronger Design Community:**  
- Facilitate regular, meaningful opportunities for designers to connect, share knowledge, and mentor one another.  
- Reestablish the sense of community that existed within the Ontario Digital Service.

**#6 – Expand Career Growth Opportunities:**  
- Introduce new roles that allow designers to advance without moving into management.  
- Create pathways for senior designers to become design leads or heads of service design operations.

**#7 – Support Professional Development:**  
- Allocate dedicated time and funding for ongoing learning, including hands-on training and courses.  
- Promote existing resources and encourage designers to take advantage of internal development programs.

**#8 – Foster Impactful Work:**  
- Ensure projects have clear goals and meaningful outcomes to maintain designer motivation.  
- Implement metrics to measure the social impact of design projects, showing designers the tangible results of their work.
