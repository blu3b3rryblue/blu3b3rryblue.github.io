![Portrait of Nadia](/images/nadia-profile2.jpg)

I’m a researcher, designer and community worker interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that center [low tech](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/low-tech-solutions/), [lo-TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge)](https://www.lo-tek.com/), and [degrowth](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bc0e610abd04bd1e067ccc/t/5cb6db356e9a7f14e5322a62/1555487546989/Hickel+-+Degrowth%2C+A+Theory+of+Radical+Abundance.pdf) as ways to sustain and care for the collective well-being of all life.

I also make photographs.

> *“We are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people. It’s talking and walking around with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice. The point of calling it ‘study’ is to mark that the incessant and irreversible intellectuality of these activities is already present.”*
