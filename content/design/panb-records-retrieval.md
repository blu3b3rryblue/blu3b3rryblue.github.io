## Provincial Archives of New Brunswick

The Provincial Archives of New Brunswick (PANB), established in 1967, is a government institution responsible for the preservation, management, and dissemination of the province’s historical records. Under provincial legislation, the PANB has a responsibility to assemble, and to make available for research, records bearing upon the history of New Brunswick.

## Challenges

**Undocumented Records**  
Some cartographic records lacked proper location documentation, with their whereabouts known only to a single manager. This created a risk in the event of staff changes.

**Inconsistent Finding Aids**  
The quality and availability of finding aids were inconsistent, complicating the retrieval of specific cartographic records.

**Failing Stickers**  
Identification stickers often fell off due to being incompatible with the environmental conditions in the repository, making it harder to locate records.

**Confusing Software System**  
The in-house software used for managing digital finding aids had usability issues, impacting its effectiveness for record retrieval.

**No Digital Check-In/Check-Out Process**  
Relying on a paper-based retrieval system made it difficult to track the status of records. This led to inefficiencies, record loss, and a lack of accurate updates.

## Solutions Implemented

**Centralized Knowledge**  
I compiled all finding aids, documentation, and informal knowledge into a single, accessible repository.

**Digital Transformation**  
Cartographic records were input into the existing software system, improving accessibility, organization, and retrieval speed.

**Durable Labeling**  
Removed failing stickers and used pencil markings directly on the margins of records for long-lasting identification.

## Limitations

**User Research and Testing**  
At the time, I lacked the resources for thorough user research and formal usability testing, relying mainly on feedback from coworkers and supervisors.

**Software Updates**  
I did not have the authority or expertise to push for software changes, as user experience was not a priority for the institution at that time.

## Comprehensive Evaluation Plan
After completing a graduate-level course *Information Systems, Services, and Design*, I created a comprehensive evaluation plan for the PANB’s cartographic records system. This plan outlines strategies for improving system usability, efficiency, and overall performance.

## Takeaways
This project was the catalyst for me pursuing a Master of Information specializing in User Experience Design because it underscored the importance of deeply understanding users' needs and perspectives when crafting effective systems.
