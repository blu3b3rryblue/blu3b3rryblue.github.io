## Provincial Archives of New Brunswick

The Provincial Archives of New Brunswick (PANB), established in 1967, is a government institution responsible for the preservation, management, and dissemination of the province’s historical records. Under provincial legislation, the PANB has a responsibility to assemble, and to make available for research, records bearing upon the history of New Brunswick.

## Project Background

The PANB aimed to make inventory of the cartographic records to ensure which records are known, available, and accessible to researchers.

## Discovery Research

In-depth discovery was needed to understand the complex processes and data:

- The Manager of the Special Media Unit and the Manager of the Cartographic Records walked me through the existing process to find a cartographic record.
- A comparative analysis helped me understand what was working and not working with cartographic record keeping at other government archives. 
- Mapping the process made me realize how confusing the existing processes are and helped me see how I could streamline the data.
- I retrieved all of the physical and digital lists I could find that would point to where certain cartographic records lived in the repository, and consulted with the managers. 

### **Challenges**

- **Undocumented Records:** Some cartographic records lacked proper location documentation, with their whereabouts known only to a single manager. This created a risk in the event of staff changes.
- **Inconsistent Finding Aids:** The quality and availability of finding aids were inconsistent, complicating the retrieval of specific cartographic records.
- **Failing Stickers:** Identification stickers often fell off due to being incompatible with the environmental conditions in the repository, making it harder to locate records.
- **Confusing Software System:** The in-house software used for managing digital finding aids had usability issues, impacting its effectiveness for record retrieval.
- **No Digital Check-In/Check-Out Process:** Relying on a paper-based retrieval system made it difficult to track the status of records. This led to inefficiencies, record loss, and a lack of accurate updates.

## Design

I ideated based off of the findings from the discovery research, consulted with managers, and moved forward with the most impactful X feasible solutions.

- **Centralized Knowledge:** I compiled all finding aids, documentation, and informal knowledge into a single, accessible repository.
- **Digital Transformation:** Cartographic records were input into the existing software system, improving accessibility, organization, and retrieval speed.
- **Durable Labeling:** Removed failing stickers and used pencil markings directly on the margins of records for long-lasting identification.

### **Limitations**

- **User Research and Testing:** At the time, I lacked the resources for thorough user research and formal usability testing, relying mainly on feedback from coworkers and supervisors.
- **Software Updates:** I did not have the authority or expertise to push for software changes, as user experience was not a priority for the institution at that time.

### **Comprehensive Evaluation Plan**
After completing a graduate-level course *Information Systems, Services, and Design*, I created a comprehensive evaluation plan for the PANB’s cartographic records system. This plan outlines strategies for improving system usability, efficiency, and overall performance.

## Takeaways
This project was the catalyst for me pursuing a Master of Information specializing in User Experience Design because it underscored the importance of deeply understanding users' needs and perspectives when crafting effective systems.
