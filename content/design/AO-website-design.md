## The Archives of Ontario

The Archives of Ontario (AO) is the largest provincial archives in Canada, and the premier source of information about the history of the land of so-called Ontario and its people.

## Project Background

The AO aimed to create a more user-friendly website to improve how researchers access and navigate their archival collections. This included making previously hard-to-find research guides more accessible and consolidating data tables to streamline the research process.

---

## Challenges

- The research guides—essential documents that help users locate historical records—were only available as PDFs scattered across the website.
- Users faced a confusing two-step process: first finding a record, then locating it in microfilm or digital archives.
- Many researchers struggled with unclear instructions, fragmented data, and a lack of intuitive navigation.

---

## Research & Insights

### Discovery Research
- Conducted interviews with 6 expert and novice users.
- Analyzed 8 comparative archives to understand best practices and identify common pain points.
- Mapped the existing workflows to clarify the complexities researchers faced.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Fragmented Data:** Multiple sources of information needed to be combined into a single, searchable location.
2. **User Frustration:** Confusing instructions and disorganized tables made even simple tasks difficult.
3. **Generational Needs:** While experienced researchers developed their own methods, novices often felt overwhelmed and sought direct guidance.

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Initial Prototyping
- Combined 66 microfilm table webpages, a 32-page research guide, and a 3-page pathfinder into two consolidated, searchable tables.
- Introduced a new page layout that made research guides easy to find and the steps clearly laid out.

### Phase 2: Iteration
- Conducted usability tests on the first prototype. Found that instructions were still being overlooked.
- Incorporated feedback into a second prototype, moving instructions into clickable accordions for improved visibility.
- Adjusted table filters to the left side to increase discoverability of data.

### Final Proposed Design
- **Simplified Navigation:** Data tables with consolidated information.
- **Contextual Instructions:** Key instructions placed where users need them most.
- **Improved Findability:** Filters positioned for optimal usability.
- **Content Best Practices:** Plain language and clear, concise guidance.

---

## Usability Testing

**Version 1 Testing:**  
- Users still skipped steps and didn’t read the instructions.  
**Key Change:**  
- Introduced accordions to make instructions more visible.

**Version 2 Testing:**  
- Iterated on table design, refined filters, and expanded helpful notes.  
**Key Insight:**  
- Users preferred the more guided, streamlined approach of the second prototype.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue collaborating with the Archives of Ontario to finalize the content.
- Work with vendors to implement the approved designs.
- Plan additional usability testing sessions to ensure the best possible user experience.
