## The Greater Toronto Eritrean Canadian Community Centre  
The Greater Toronto Eritrean Canadian Community Centre (GTECCC) has been a cornerstone for Eritrean-Canadians in Ontario, ensuring support for vulnerable populations such as newcomers, refugees, youth, and seniors. 

## Challenges  

**Scattered, Temporary Information**  
GTECCC currently relies on WhatsApp and Facebook to provide their services to the Eritrean community in the GTA. However, these platforms are not serving the diverse needs of the community as the decentralized and temporary nature of messages and posts makes accessing GTECCC’s resources difficult. 

**Spam and Trust Issues**  
From an administrative perspective, GTECCC faces challenges with spam posting on their Facebook and Whatsapp groups which burdens other users and distracts from important resources that GTECCC shares in these groups. 

**Language and Digital Barriers**  
Many community members faced language challenges or limited digital literacy, making it hard to participate fully.

**Generational Disconnect**  
Younger members felt disconnected from traditional events, while older members struggled to foster engagement across generations.

## Research and Analysis  
Our team employed a participatory research approach, using the World Café method to gather insights from community members. We facilitated discussions, card-sorting activities, and drawing sessions, engaging all types of members including newcomers, seniors, youth, and board members. Data was captured and affinity mapped on Miro.

**Key Insights**  
GTECCC members sought a centralized digital hub where they could easily access relevant resources in both English and Tigrinya, connect with one another across generations, and have their voices heard in the services provided by GTECCC.

## Design Approach  
Based on our research, we proposed a structured, user-centered design solution for GTECCC’s website:  

**Comprehensive Resource Guides**
The website features a robust set of resource guides, with a particular focus on the Newcomers Guide, helping individuals navigate settlement, employment, healthcare, education, and more. These guides serve as a permanent, one-stop hub for essential information, making it easier for community members to access support. 

**Purpose Driven Integration**
The website complements, rather than replaces, existing communication tools. WhatsApp remains the space for real-time updates and conversations, Facebook is used for broader outreach and community engagement, while the website serves as a structured, permanent home for resources, events, and official information.   

**Feedback Form** 
A dedicated space allows users to share feedback anonymously about GTECCC services. This fosters honest community input, helping the organization continuously improve its programs and better serve its members. 

**Community Articles and Storytelling** 
The website integrates a community blog where members can submit stories, insights, and experiences. This helps strengthen community ties, highlight achievements, and showcase the diverse voices within GTECCC.

**Mentorship Programs** 
Integrated a mentorship program with its own page, sign-up forms for both mentees and mentors, and advertising it throughout the site (e.g. on the homepage and on the resource pages).
