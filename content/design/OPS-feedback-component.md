## ServiceOntario

ServiceOntario (SO) is part of the Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery and Procurement (MPBSDP) which provides a single point of contact for core provincial government services to individuals and businesses in the province of Ontario.

## Project Background

SO lacked standardized methods and workflows for collecting customer feedback across centres, services, and channels. This inconsistency led to unreliable data — for example, a change in one service’s feedback method significantly skewed the overall Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score. Without accurate insights, program areas struggled to improve services effectively.

The Experience Design Team supported multiple SO workstreams to map the feedback ecosystem and data flows. In collaboration with the Voice of Customers program, we worked to define SO-wide standards for collecting and using customer feedback.
