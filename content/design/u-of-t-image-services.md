## Stakeholder and User Needs
I conducted informal discussions with employees and the manager.

- **Image Technicians** wanted clear guidance on the various hardware and software tools at their disposal, along with quick, accessible answers while working independently. They also emphasized the need for practices that consistently meet archival standards.
- **The Visual Resource Curator** sought a thorough evaluation of available hardware and software, along with concise user guides to support both new and experienced employees in meeting professional archival benchmarks.

## Process Steps

**1. Exploration and Testing**  
I conducted a detailed examination of multiple scanning and editing techniques. By testing each approach, I assessed their influence on image quality and user experience, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methods.

**2. Data Analysis**  
Using the results from these tests, I identified which methods delivered the best clarity, color accuracy, and user satisfaction. This analysis informed my recommendations for the most effective and user-friendly practices.

**3. Formulation of Best Practices**  
With the data in hand, I developed a clear set of best practices tailored to the unique needs of the Image Services department. These guidelines provided consistent, reliable instructions for image scanning and editing.

**4. User Guide Development**  
I translated these best practices into step-by-step user guides. By incorporating visual aids and clear instructions, I ensured that the guides were accessible and easy to follow, even for those working independently.

**5. Feedback Integration**  
Throughout the process, I collected feedback from the supervisor and colleagues to ensure that the guides met real-world needs. This feedback was crucial in refining the content and making the guides as helpful and practical as possible.

**6. Distribution**  
Finally, I organized and distributed the completed guides through official departmental channels, ensuring that everyone could easily access the resources they needed to perform their tasks efficiently and to professional standards.

## Takeaways

- **Importance of Feedback:** I realized the importance of feedback from both the supervisor and the colleagues when designing the user guides, as it ensured that they were tailored to meet the specific needs and expectations of all stakeholders.
- **Ensure Easy Access:** Even the most comprehensive guides lose their value if they aren’t readily accessible. Ensuring that colleagues can easily find and use these resources is essential to keeping everyone aligned and informed.
