## Image Services

Image Services maintains the Art History Department's extensive 35mm slide collection and provides services such as digital imaging, image sourcing, software consultations, and audiovisual equipment support for classroom and event use. 

## Challenges

**As Image Technicians often operate independently, ensuring they have comprehensive resources for their tasks is crucial.** Recognizing the need for established best practices, I initiated the creation of user guides to provide clear instructions and support. Understanding the need for consistency in achieving archival quality, I conducted extensive testing on various machines and software, aiming to identify the most effective tools and methods for our workflows.

## Stakeholder and User Needs

**What Employees Wanted:**
Employees wanted clear guidance on the various hardware and software tools at their disposal, along with quick, accessible answers while working independently. They also emphasized the need for practices that consistently meet archival standards.

**What the Visual Resource Curator Wanted:**
The Visual Resource Curator sought a thorough evaluation of available hardware and software, along with concise user guides to support both new and experienced employees in meeting professional archival benchmarks.

## Process Steps

**1. Exploration and Testing**  
I conducted a detailed examination of multiple scanning and editing techniques. By testing each approach, I assessed their influence on image quality and user experience, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methods.

**2. Data Analysis**  
Using the results from these tests, I identified which methods delivered the best clarity, color accuracy, and user satisfaction. This analysis informed my recommendations for the most effective and user-friendly practices.

**3. Formulation of Best Practices**  
With the data in hand, I developed a clear set of best practices tailored to the unique needs of the Image Services department. These guidelines provided consistent, reliable instructions for image scanning and editing.

**4. User Guide Development**  
I translated these best practices into step-by-step user guides. By incorporating visual aids and clear instructions, I ensured that the guides were accessible and easy to follow, even for those working independently.

**5. Feedback Integration**  
Throughout the process, I collected feedback from the supervisor and colleagues to ensure that the guides met real-world needs. This feedback was crucial in refining the content and making the guides as helpful and practical as possible.

**6. Distribution**  
Finally, I organized and distributed the completed guides through official departmental channels, ensuring that everyone could easily access the resources they needed to perform their tasks efficiently and to professional standards.

## Outcomes

The project resulted in two user guides with clear guidance for users engaging in scanning and editing processes:

**EPSON V850 User Guide**  
A concise manual providing instructions and information on the operation and features of the EPSON V850 slide scanning hardware and software.  


**Adobe Photoshop User Guide**  
A concise manual providing instructions and insights into the functionality and optimal use of frequently employed tools within the Adobe Photoshop software.

## Takeaways

**Importance of Feedback**  
I realized the importance of feedback from both the supervisor and the colleagues when designing the user guides, as it ensured that they were tailored to meet the specific needs and expectations of all stakeholders.

**Easy Access**  
Even the most comprehensive guides lose their value if they arenâ€™t readily accessible. Ensuring that colleagues can easily find and use these resources is essential to keeping everyone aligned and informed.
