In the fall of 2021, the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick
collaborated with the Beaverbrook Art Gallery
to present an array of documentary art found at
the Archives. Since time and space were factors in the
types of artistic records chosen, photographic records
were not considered for display. I was
curious about the decision and its connection to the
longstanding debate about the classification of photography as an art form versus a kind of science.

The Library and Archives of Canada defines documentary art as “drawings, paintings, prints, medals,
seals, heraldic devices, posters, reproductions or caricatures that document Canadian history, government
and social development. Documentary art records
also include objects considered as ephemera, such as
trading cards, postcards, greeting cards, flyers, buttons
and lapel pins. Visual documents may not only depict
objects, scenes, historical events and people, but they
may also reflect public opinion and attitudes, and, at
times, they can become cultural symbols, as often seen
in government promotional campaigns.” How does
photojournalism fit into the definition of documentary
art and what kinds of photographic art does the PANB
have in their holdings?
