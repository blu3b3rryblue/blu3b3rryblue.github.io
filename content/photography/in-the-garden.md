In [*in the garden* (1:49min)](https://vimeo.com/523039338), I face the webcam both outwards and closer inwards, straying away from the normative display of the physical self on webcam. I specifically focus on the haptic nature of experience, and how that physicality is transforming while we increasingly live our day-to-day lives on screen. Importance is placed on the disconnection of our senses when on screen and attempts to express our longing for touch. I push physical experiences through the screen medium. I display a longing for a physical dimension of screen experience. I question our new reality, our new relationship to reality, our new screen sensibility. How does the webcam change our visions of the world and of ourselves?

Sound plays a role in our experience of physicality. I draw from composer Miya Masaoka’s use of biofeedback to produce “plant sounds” in real-time on a modular synthesizer. I extend this exploration of nature versus machine with the function of using my 10-year old laptop and it’s built in microphone to pick up the sounds of my exploration into the garden.

Nature is often regarded as a place of refuge from trauma. *to see the earth before the end of the world* explores our changing relationship to nature amidst climate and political catastrophe.
