*to see the earth before the end of the world* draws its name from the poetry book by Ed Roberson and explores our evolving relationship with the natural environment. The work manifests as a collection of videos and screenshots that explore what it means to increasingly live so much of our lives on screen in an age of societal and environmental catastrophe.

*Street view of One Hundred Steps* is of my estranged father's hometown in Trinidad. *in the garden #6*, is a screenshot from a webcam recording taken in a garden in Victoria, British Columbia during the height of the pandemic. Through these pieces, I examine how screens mediate and shape our understanding of space, place, and belonging.
