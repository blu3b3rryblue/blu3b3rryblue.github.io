 Using the same medium as classical large format landscape photographers, *the saturated zone* questions the dynamics of “untouched” and “objective” depictions of the land. Instead, the work gives less weight on idealized landscape imagery and more on the role of the self perceiving, photographing, and existing on the land. The work gestures towards an inextricable relationship to land through themes of migration. The Pacific ocean (depicted) is a place of transition, uncertainty, and (dis)connection.

Each image was digitally colourized from a 4x5 large format black and white negative.
