*Psithurisms in the urban experience* looks to the harsh circumstances faced by trees in urban settings in order to reflect on the broader implications of urbanity and industrialization. 

The work is largely influenced by Peter Wohlleben’s *The Hidden Life of Trees* who writes a chapter on “street kids”; the trees that live in urban environments. These types of trees are unable to communicate as they are missing their relatives and grow alone in solitude. The soil in urban areas is depleted of nutrients and packed too tight for trees to properly expand underground. The mechanics of planting and pruning affect the susceptibility to fungal infections and eventually lead to premature death.  

All images were taken on the traditional and unceded territories of the Lkwungen-speaking peoples.
