We leave traces everywhere we go. I collected all of my garbage and recycling waste for a month and displayed it in my living room to make visible what is often invisibilized in the “Global North”. While our social and environmental challenges extend beyond individual responsibility, our waste is often too conveniently taken away from us, making it easier to ignore these challenges. This convenience is made possible by the invisible labour of those who manage and dispose of our waste, as well as the land, where our discarded materials are shipped and taken out of sight.
