Created with light-sensitive cyanotype paper exposed in a 4x5 view camera over six days, *in parallel* reflects an evolving image over time. The work speaks to worlds beyond what meets the eyeâ€”worlds filled with hauntings of the past and shadows of the future. It invites viewers to recognize that place is layered with multiple realities. How do we experience pasts, presents, and futures as interconnected threads in a shared fabric of life? How do we hold multiple truths and realities within a single moment, embracing coexisting ways of being?
