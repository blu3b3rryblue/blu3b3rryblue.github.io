*i’ll remember you not as you were, but as what you’ll become* is an ongoing series that speaks to themes of grief and renewal. The work draws from [Sky Hopkin’s tribute film for poet Diane Burns entitled *I’ll Remember You as You Were, Not as What You’ll Become*](https://www.skyhopinka.com/ill-remember-you-as-you-were). The film focuses on markers of time and place to form a vivid meditation on mortality and reincarnation. A play on words on Burns’ title, I aim to ease the often intruding thoughts of loved ones right before death by focussing on where their energy lies after passing, outside the current socio-enviro-economic state.
